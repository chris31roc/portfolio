#### Responsive Portfolio 11/17/2020
#### By Christopher Hicks

## Description
This project is to focus on the skills that I have learned thus far in the
program by creating a responsive design that ensures the web applications render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes by using Bootstrap.

## Features

* 3 responsive HTML pages (index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html).

* Navbar cohesive on all 3 pages .

* Navbar is tagged with a sticky top to ensure it stays at the 
top whenever the user scolls down.

* Footer is cohesive on all 3 pages and is fixed at the bottom
to ensure that you can see the contents of the footer when the user 
scrolls down or up.

* index.html page consists of main bio and a photo of me

* Portfolio page consists of photos of my work and travels that 
render well when sized down or to large screens.

* Contact page consists of a form for the user to enter his or her 
contact info and can leave a message if they so shall please.

* Contact page also consists of my social media outlets to enure the
user can conncet with me immediately.
