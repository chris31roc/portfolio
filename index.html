               Hello World! My name is Christopher Hicks, born and raised in Washington, D.C. I am currently
               living in Newark, New Jersey pursuing my career in aviation as a Flight Attendant with United Airlines.
               I have since experienced what being furloughed feels like due to the Covid-19 Pandemic that we all 
               lived through. <br><br>
               
               
               Before experiencing such devastiation, I've always felt that I could do something in conjuction
               because my schedule was so flexible. Something that would stimulate my passions mentally and artistically, 
               just as aviation stimulated my passion for people and travel. With a great deal of thought and pursuing 
               interests, nothing stuck that I could see myself doing long term. <br><br>

               
               With the pandemic being as devasting as it has been to the aviation industry, the need to find a second 
               option became more evident and thus my time to focus on such increased dramatically. <br><br>

               
               After coming across an advertisement for the George Washington University Coding Boot Camp for
               full stack web development, I had the eureka moment that I had been searching for. The combination of 
               my passions and interests rolled into one program deemed to be the perfect aligning for someone like me.
               Problem solving and the ability to create and design anything plays right into my strengths as a person
               who equipped oneself with the hard skills of playing three different musical instruments, which in 
               turn played to my soft skills. <br><br>


               As of April 29, 2021, I have graduated from the George Washngton University Coding Boot Camp for 
               full stack wed development and looking forward to continue my journey in the technology community
               as a full stack web developer. <br><br>
               
               
               Cheers to new beginnings!!!
