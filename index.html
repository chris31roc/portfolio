                Hello World! My name is Christopher Hicks, born and raised in Washington, D.C. I went to the historically 
                black college, Winston Salem State University in North Carolina, where I studied music business with a 
                focus in music production. For as long as I could remember, I have always been fascinated with how things 
                worked and how they were made. From how sound comes out of speakers, how images are shown on the tv, the 
                design of buildings and cities, to how things worked on the computer. I just wanted to know how everything 
                was made and how it worked and if I could do that too. I pursued these interests in college by following 
                one of my first loves, music. <br><br>
               
               
                Still having that passion to figure out how things work and to make them perform, I came across an 
                advertisement for the George Washington University Coding Boot Camp for full stack web development on Twitter. 
                The combination of my passions and interests rolled into one program deemed to be the perfect alignment for 
                someone like me. Having the aptitude to problem solve and be given the ability to create and design anything, 
                plays right into my strengths as a person. <br><br>
               
               
                As of April 29, 2021, I have graduated from the George Washington University Coding Boot Camp for full stack 
                web development and looking forward to continuing my journey in the technology community as a full stack web 
                developer. <br><br>

               
                Cheers to new beginnings!!!
